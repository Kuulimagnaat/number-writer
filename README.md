# number-writer
This program takes as an input a number and outputs its description as it would be said in Estonian.
As a programming language it uses Python and doesn't use any packages or libraries.
Here is only the main file, which contains all of the code. If you want to convert it to exe- or any other executable, you have to do it by yourself.
